# Dynamic Entity Hider



A dynamic version of the standard RuneLite Entity Hider. This plugin allows you to hide players and NPCs for performance and clarity while maintaining visibility for entities you are currently interacting with.





\*\*Unique Features\*\*

Unlike the standard hider, this plugin "remembers" entities you've recently interacted with. Even if a fight pauses or an entity stops attacking for a few ticks, they stay visible for a customizable duration.

Uses interaction-based logic rather than attacker-based tracking to ensure a fair and safe experience.

Settings are categorized into Players, NPCs, and Global sections for a cleaner user interface.



\*\*Interaction Logic\*\*

A menu (0-300 seconds) to determine how long an entity stays visible after the interaction ends.



\*\*Credits\*\*

Based on the original Entity Hider by \[Lotto](https://github.com/devLotto).

Modified with Dynamic Memory logic by Lightemupp.
